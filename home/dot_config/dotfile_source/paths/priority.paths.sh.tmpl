# Priority paths - tools that should override system defaults
# These paths are added first (highest priority)

# Note: pnpm PATH is now handled by unified installation function
# Configuration is written to ~/.config/shell/pnpm.sh

# Other high-priority tools can be added here
# Example: export PATH="/path/to/priority/tool:${PATH}"
