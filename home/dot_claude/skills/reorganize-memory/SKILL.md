# Reorganize Memory

Always use plan mode — show the user what you intend to change before changing anything.

## Target structure

Documented in `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`. This skill enforces it.

**Global memory** — `~/.claude/memory/` (knowledge Claude accumulates)

- `memory.md` — index, `@`-imported by CLAUDE.md so it loads at session start
- `general.md` — cross-project conventions and quality gates. **Stay lean** — not a dumping ground for everything; behavioral rules go in `~/.claude/rules/`.
- `tools/{tool}.md` — one file per tool (bun, chezmoi, mise, television, etc.). Lazy-loaded.
- `domain/{topic}.md` — domain knowledge per product/area. Lazy-loaded.
- `SESSION_LOG.md` — cross-device session log (auto-appended by `/close`)
- `projects.md` — index of active project MEMORY.md paths
- `personal.md` — notes about people

**Behavioral rules** — native Claude Code mechanism; instructions, not facts (code.claude.com/docs/en/memory#organize-rules-with-claude/rules/). Two scopes:

- **User** `~/.claude/rules/{topic}.md` — personal, all projects. This skill maintains these.
- **Project** `.claude/rules/{topic}.md` — team-shared, lives in the repo (tracked). Managed in-repo, NOT by this skill. User rules load before project rules, so project rules win on conflict.
- One rule per file. Rules with `paths:` frontmatter load only when Claude reads matching files (use for file-type/dir-scoped conventions, e.g. CLAUDE.md, MEMORY.md, `src/api/**`). Rules without `paths:` load every session — reserve for safety + universal style (pay-per-session context).
- `.claude/rules/` supports symlinks for sharing one rule across projects.

**Project memory** — `~/.claude/projects/{mapped-cwd}/memory/`

Canonical Claude Code auto-memory model (code.claude.com/docs/en/memory): a
`MEMORY.md` **index** plus **topic/fact sibling files**. `MEMORY.md` is the index
loaded at session start (first 200 lines / 25KB); sibling files are recalled on
demand. Keep `MEMORY.md` concise by **moving detail OUT to sibling files** — never
collapse siblings into `MEMORY.md` sections. Sibling granularity (broad
`debugging.md` topic files vs one-fact-per-file) is the project's choice; preserve
whatever auto-memory has written.

**Legacy patterns (do NOT create new):**
- Prefix-based filenames at the root of the **global** `~/.claude/memory/` — `feedback_X.md`, `user_X.md`, `project_X.md`, `reference_X.md`. Out of step with Drew's structured global system (general.md / tools/ / domain/ / rules/). NOTE: in **project** memory dirs (`~/.claude/projects/*/memory/`) an index + sibling files IS the canonical auto-memory model — those are NOT legacy; do not migrate them away.
- Files under `~/.claude/memory/feedback/` — superseded by `~/.claude/rules/` (native rules mechanism). Migrate to rules/ and strip `type: feedback` frontmatter.

## Workflow

1. **Plan mode entry** — call EnterPlanMode (or note in conversation that we're operating cautiously). All destructive operations require explicit confirmation per the global memory rules.

2. **Read all memory and rules files in scope**:
   - `~/.claude/memory/memory.md` and every file in the index
   - `~/.claude/memory/{tools,domain}/**/*.md`
   - `~/.claude/memory/feedback/**/*.md` (if exists — should be empty / removed; legacy location)
   - `~/.claude/rules/**/*.md`
   - `~/.claude/memory/projects.md` (if exists)
   - For each path in `projects.md`: that project's `memory/MEMORY.md` + any sibling files in the same directory (auto-memory may have written topic files there)
   - `~/.claude/memory.bak.*/` directories — pre-existing memory content auto-backed-up by chezmoi when the vault symlink landed on a fresh machine. Treat as merge candidates.

3. **Build a proposal** — for each candidate change, identify:
   - **Legacy-pattern files** — prefix-based files (`feedback_*.md`, `user_*.md`, `project_*.md`, `reference_*.md`) at the root of the **global** `~/.claude/memory/` only (NOT project memory dirs — there they are the canonical store). Propose migration based on content:
     - Behavioral rule / correction → new `~/.claude/rules/{topic}.md`
     - Cross-project convention / quality gate → merge into `general.md`
     - Tool-specific knowledge → `~/.claude/memory/tools/{tool}.md` (new file or append)
     - Domain/product knowledge → `~/.claude/memory/domain/{topic}.md`
     - Project-specific workflow/state → move to a topic/sibling file in that project's `memory/` dir and add a one-line `MEMORY.md` index pointer (do not inline into a MEMORY.md section)
   - **Files in legacy `~/.claude/memory/feedback/`** — migrate each to `~/.claude/rules/{topic}.md`. Strip `type: feedback` frontmatter (native rules don't use it). For file-type-specific rules, add `paths:` frontmatter so they only load when Claude reads matching files.
   - **`general.md` bloat** — if `general.md` has grown beyond ~50 lines or contains content that's clearly behavioral guidance rather than a flat convention/quality gate, propose extracting to `~/.claude/rules/{topic}.md` files.
   - **Project `MEMORY.md` over budget** — when the index nears 200 lines / 25KB: keep it a lean index (one short hook per entry), shorten verbose hooks, and move any detail that crept into `MEMORY.md` OUT to sibling topic files. Dedup / merge / drop stale sibling files (extract durable content first; confirm before delete). Do NOT collapse siblings into `MEMORY.md` sections — siblings are the canonical store; the index just points to them.
   - **Stale audits/inventories** — date-stamped audit lists, `⚠ Last seen` markers older than ~30 days, snapshots of tool installs or package lists. Per the Note-keeping bias section in `~/.claude/memory/working-patterns.md`, the **content rots but the rationale survives**. For each candidate drop:
     1. Identify durable patterns / decisions / rationale (the "why" and "how" — not the "what" of static inventories).
     2. Extract those into the appropriate global file (`~/.claude/memory/tools/{tool}.md`, `~/.claude/memory/domain/{topic}.md`, or `~/.claude/rules/{topic}.md`) BEFORE proposing the drop.
     3. Only propose drop AFTER the extraction is in the migration plan.
     Never propose a bare DROP without first listing what durable content would be lost. Files under `~/.claude/projects/*/memory/` were auto-generated by Claude across past sessions — they're a record of captured insights, not just transient state. Treat extraction as the default, drop as the exception.
   - **Duplicates** — entries appearing in multiple files. Recommend merge.
   - **Merge candidates** — separate files covering the same topic. Recommend single file.
   - **Split candidates** — files too large or covering multiple topics. Recommend split.
   - **Re-sort** — entries within each file should be ordered by date (latest last) where dates exist.
   - **Index drift** — `memory.md` table doesn't reflect current files.
   - **Migration candidates from `.bak.*`** — for each `~/.claude/memory.bak.<timestamp>/` directory:
     - Diff against `~/.claude/memory/`.
     - For files unique to `.bak`: propose copying into the canonical structure (`general.md` / `~/.claude/memory/tools/` / `~/.claude/memory/domain/` / `~/.claude/rules/`), not as legacy-pattern files.
     - For files in both: propose merge if different, skip if identical.
     - After successful merge confirmation: offer to delete the `.bak` dir.
     - Never silently auto-delete a `.bak` dir; require explicit user approval.

4. **Present the proposal** as a single ordered list with current → proposed for each change. Use AskUserQuestion (multiSelect) to let the user approve a subset.

5. **Apply approved changes**:
   - Use Write/Edit for content modifications.
   - Use Bash for `mv` / `rm`.
   - For deletes/renames of entries with content: confirm before each via AskUserQuestion if not already approved.

6. **Update indexes**:
   - `memory.md` table refreshes with current files and Last updated dates.
   - `projects.md` table refreshes if project memories changed.
   - If `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` lists topic files, update that list too (and the chezmoi source `home/dot_claude/CLAUDE.md.tmpl` if it differs). Keep that list **lean** — show folders rather than enumerating every file.

7. **Summary** — concise list of what changed, plus a `cvault status` reminder so Drew can push the vault.

## Constraints

- Never delete or modify an existing entry without explicit user confirmation, even if the user previously asked for the file.
- Preserve entry frontmatter (`name`, `description`, `type`) when merging or splitting.
- Never re-sort by mtime — only by content dates (frontmatter or in-body `**Last seen YYYY-MM-DD**` markers). If no date exists, sort alphabetically.
- Don't propose changes to WIP/scratch areas (e.g. `domain/{topic}/draft.md` explicitly marked draft).
- **Never create new files in the legacy patterns.** Legacy patterns are: (a) prefix-based filenames at the root of a memory directory (`feedback_X.md`, `user_X.md`, `project_X.md`, `reference_X.md`); (b) files under `~/.claude/memory/feedback/` (superseded by `~/.claude/rules/`). New content placement:
  - `~/.claude/memory/general.md` — conventions and quality gates (lean, ~50 lines)
  - `~/.claude/memory/tools/{tool}.md` — tool knowledge (lazy-loaded)
  - `~/.claude/memory/domain/{topic}.md` — product/area knowledge (lazy-loaded)
  - `~/.claude/rules/{topic}.md` — behavioral rules. Strip `type:` frontmatter; add `paths:` for file-type-specific rules.
  - Project content → a topic/sibling file in that project's `memory/` dir, pointed to by a one-line `MEMORY.md` index entry.
- Project memory = a `MEMORY.md` index + topic/sibling files (canonical auto-memory model, v2.1.59+). Compact by trimming the index and curating sibling files; never collapse siblings into `MEMORY.md` sections. **Preserve autonomous writes** — never delete a sibling without first reading it and confirming with the user.
- Keep `general.md` lean (~50 lines target). It loads at session start every time — pay-per-byte. Behavioral rules belong in `~/.claude/rules/{topic}.md`. Rules load eagerly by default; for file-type-specific rules, use `paths:` frontmatter so they only load when relevant.
